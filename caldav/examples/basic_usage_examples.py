## password is also probably nice to have.  The DAVClient object also
## supports a proxy (URL), an auth object (to be passed to the
## requests library, instead of using username and password) and a
## boolean ssl_verify_cert that can be set to False for self-signed
## certificates.

    ## To make it easy to actually execute this test code, connection
    ## details to your caldav server can be given in the

## A DAVClient object should be set up with the connection details.
## Initiating the object does not cause any requests to the server.

## To modify an event, it's best to use either the vobject or icalendar module for it.  The caldav library has always been supporting vobject out of the box, but icalendar is more popular.  event.instance will as of version 0.x yield a vobject instance, but this may change in future versions.  Use .vobject_instance or .icalendar_instance instead.

## It's possible to access objects such as calendars without going
## through a Principal object, i.e. if one knows the URL
the_same_calendar = caldav.Calendar(client=client, url=my_new_calendar.url)

## to get all events from the calendar, it's also possible to use the
## events()-method.  Recurring events will not be expanded.
all_events = the_same_calendar.events()

## Let's check that the summary got right
assert all_events[0].vobject_instance.vevent.summary.value.startswith('Norwegian')

## This calendar should as a minimum support VEVENTs ... most likely
## it also supports VTODOs and maybe even VJOURNALs.  We can query the
## server what it can accept:
acceptable_component_types = my_new_calendar.get_supported_components()
assert 'VEVENT' in acceptable_component_types

## Clean up - remove the new calendar
my_new_calendar.delete()

## Let's try with a task list.  Some servers cannot combine events and todos in the same calendar.
my_new_tasklist = my_principal.make_calendar(
            name="Test tasklist", supported_calendar_component_set=['VTODO'])
